# Repository manager

In some cases it's better for me to used binary compiled on my own from source code. Problem with this approach is that I can't easly track if there are any udpates, and I need to use sets of difrrent commands based on repository. Goal of this project is to provide such a tool that I could track selected repositories stored on my local machine with and massivle update and install selected ones.

# Compile

```
cargo run [options to pass] # for test
cargo build --release # for release build
```

# Usage

To see commands use `repman help`
